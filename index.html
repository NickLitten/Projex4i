          <p>Just what is Projex4i ?</p>

<p>The PROJEX4i Application is an IBM i application for developers and operators. It's bursting with goodies designed to make life easier for every developer, operator and user of the IBM i Power System. Speeding application development and boosting problem investigation is going to save you time and money.</p>

<p>The PROJEX4i Toolkit has evolved and been rebranded over the last few years. Continual development, enhancement and adding function:</p>

<pre><code>PGMRAID - Born on the System/38, this was a collection of QUSRTOOL like utilities. It evolved to fill holes in the software development life cycle.
PROJEX400 - The release of the IBM AS400 saw the first major revamp and rewrite of the majority of RPG code to RPG400. This was available as shareware for over ten years and over two thousand downloads.
PROJEX4i - The latest rebranding to align with IBM's new operating system - welcome to IBM 'i'
</code></pre>

<p>The PROJEX4I Software Toolkit is now available from <a href="http://www.projex.com">http://www.projex.com</a></p>

<p>Essentially PROJEX4i is a collection of Software tools; utilities, commands, and neat re-usable procedures or any other way you choose to describe them.</p>

<p>Everything in the PROJEX4i Toolkit is command driven. This allows you easy access from any command line. Another bonus is that you can apply commands to areas like PDM with ease. For example, if you wanted to use the SRTSRCMBR command to upgrade your RPG source you could simply create a PDM User Defined option running the SRTSRCMBR command and then repeat that for the entire source file that you have selected using PDM.</p>

<p>The tools are constantly evolving and new commands, enhancements to existing commands and other optional details are being added all the time. The main aim of PROJEX4i is simply to add functionality to areas of the IBM iSeries that are not necessarily simple to use, enhance existing commands within the operating system and to generate clear and simple displays providing detailed information in an easy to understand format.</p>

<p>The toolkit contains many utilities aiding IBM i developers and End users in areas as diverse as:</p>

<pre><code>Program development
Object Management
Database management
Documentation
Problem determination
Debugging
data modelling and impact analysis
Time planning and reporting
Multi-platform communications tools
Source file editing tools
User Games
and much more!

<p>Extensive On-line help text is available against all parameters for each command, and also available from any displayable screen.</p>
